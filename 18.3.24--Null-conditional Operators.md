Used to test for null before performing a member access (?.) or index (?[) operation. These operators help you write less code to handle null checks, especially for descending into data structures.

**Example1**

The last example demonstrates that the null-condition operators are short-circuiting. If one operation in a chain of conditional member access and index operation returns null, then the rest of the chain’s execution stops. Other operations with lower precedence in the expression continue. For example, E in the following executes in the second line, and the ?? and == operations execute. In the first line, the ?? short circuits and E does not execute when the left side evaluates to non-null.

```c#
int? length = customers?.Length; // null if customers is null   
Customer first = customers?[0];  // null if customers is null  
int? count = customers?[0]?.Orders?.Count();  // null if customers, the first customer, or Orders is null

A?.B?.C?[0] ?? E  
A?.B?.C?[0] == E  
```

**Example2**

Another use for the null-condition member access is invoking delegates in a thread-safe way with much less code. 

```c#
// var handler = this.PropertyChanged;
// if (handler != null)
//     handler(…);

PropertyChanged?.Invoke(e) ;
```

The new way is thread-safe because the compiler generates code to evaluate PropertyChanged one time only, keeping the result in a temporary variable.

You need to explicitly call the Invoke method because there is no null-conditional delegate invocation syntax PropertyChanged?(e).
