### Struct

The struct type is suitable for representing **lightweight** objects such as Point, Rectangle, and Color.

For example, if you declare an array of 1000 Point objects, you will allocate additional memory for referencing each object; in this case, a struct would be less expensive.

Others:

+ Structures can have defined constructors, but not destructors. However, you cannot define a default constructor for a structure. The default constructor is automatically defined and cannot be changed.
+ Unlike classes, structures cannot inherit other structures or classes.
+ Structures cannot be used as a base for other structures or classes.
+ A structure can implement one or more interfaces.

### Boxing and Unboxing

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing

**Definition:**

+ Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the **type object** or to any **interface type** implemented by this value type.
+ Unboxing extracts the value type from the object. 

**Performance:**

    In relation to simple assignments, boxing and unboxing are computationally expensive processes. When a value type is boxed, a new object must be allocated and constructed. To a lesser degree, the cast required for unboxing is also expensive computationally.

**Boxing:**

    Boxing a value type allocates an object instance on the heap and copies the value into the new object.
   
![Box an integer][1]

```c#
// This example converts an integer variable i to an object o by using boxing. Then, the value stored in the variable i is changed from 123 to 456. The example shows that the original value type and the boxed object use separate memory locations, and therefore can store different values.

class TestBoxing
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int i = 123;

        // Boxing copies the value of i into object o.
        object o = i;  

        // Change the value of i.
        i = 456;  

        // The change in i doesn't affect the value stored in o.
        System.Console.WriteLine("The value-type value = {0}", i);
        System.Console.WriteLine("The object-type value = {0}", o);
    }
}
/* Output:
    The value-type value = 456
    The object-type value = 123
*/
```
